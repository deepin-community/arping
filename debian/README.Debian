arping for Debian
-----------------

There are two different arping series from Thomas Habets: 1.xx and 2.xx.
The original source contains both versions, however this binary package
contains only the 2.xx series by this time.

Root privileges are needed to run arping. It can be made permanently
setuid by using dpkg-statoverride, but beware it's a potential security
hole.

In /usr/share/doc/arping/examples you have also a network/ip-up.d script
that uses arping to check for IP duplicates after bringing up the
interface. If the IP we're bringing up is already taken, this brings the
interface down.  If you want this check:

cp /usr/share/doc/arping/examples/arping.default /etc/default/arping
cp /usr/share/doc/arping/examples/arping.if-up /etc/network/if-up.d/arping

By default it is disabled, edit /etc/default/arping to enable this feature.
